# Array Insert Shift
We are going to build a method that make reverse action for an array of numbers.

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

The approach used in the code is to create a new array with the same length as the input array. Then, using a loop, it iterates over the input array and assigns the elements to the new array in reverse order. Finally, it returns the reversed array.

Efficiency:

Time Complexity: The code has a time complexity of O(N). This is because it iterates over the input array to create the reversed array.
Space Complexity: The code has a space complexity of O(N). It creates a new array with the same length as the input array to store the reversed elements.
## Solution
Create a new console application project, replace the default code in the Program.cs file with the corrected code from above, and run the project.
Once the code is running, you will see the output in the console.
