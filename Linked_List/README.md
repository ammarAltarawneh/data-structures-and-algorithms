# Singly Linked List Implementation

The linked list supports the following functionalities:

1- Adding a node to the head of the list.

2- Searching for a value in the list.

3- Generating a string representation of the list.

The linked list is implemented using a Node class, which represents a single node in the list. Each node has a value and a reference to the next node.
