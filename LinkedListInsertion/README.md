# Linked List Insertion
## Overview
A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in a sequence of nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence. In this project, the SinglyLinkedList class represents a singly linked list with methods to add nodes at the front, end, before a given node, and after a given node. Additionally, the class provides a method to check whether a specific value exists in the linked list.

The project also includes a unit test project (LinkedListInsertion.Tests) that contains test methods to validate the correctness of the methods implemented in the SinglyLinkedList class.

## Usage
The LinkedListInsertion project contains a Program.cs file with a Main method that demonstrates the usage of the SinglyLinkedList class. The Main method adds nodes to the front of the linked list, checks for the existence of a value, appends a node to the end, inserts a node before a given value, and inserts a node after a given value.

You can run the console application to see the output of these operations on the linked list. However, since the application requires user input, you may modify the Main method to provide values directly instead of using Console.ReadLine().
