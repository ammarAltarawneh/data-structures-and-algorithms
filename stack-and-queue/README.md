# Stack and Queue Implementation
# Summary
This application provides an implementation of the Stack and Queue data structures using a linked list as the underlying data storage mechanism. It includes the classes Stack<T> and Queue<T> which allow operations like push, pop, enqueue, dequeue, peek, and checking if the stack or queue is empty.

# Approach & Efficiency
The Stack and Queue classes are implemented using a linked list, which provides efficient insertion and removal operations at the top (for the Stack) and at both ends (for the Queue) of the list. Here's a summary of the approach and efficiency for each operation:

# Stack
Push: Inserts a new element at the top of the stack. This operation has a time complexity of O(1).

Pop: Removes and returns the element from the top of the stack. This operation has a time complexity of O(1).

Peek: Returns the element from the top of the stack without removing it. This operation has a time complexity of O(1).

IsEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty. This operation has a time complexity of O(1).
# Queue
Enqueue: Inserts a new element at the rear of the queue. This operation has a time complexity of O(1).

Dequeue: Removes and returns the element from the front of the queue. This operation has a time complexity of O(1).

Peek: Returns the element from the front of the queue without removing it. This operation has a time complexity of O(1).

IsEmpty: Checks if the queue is empty. This operation has a time complexity of O(1).
