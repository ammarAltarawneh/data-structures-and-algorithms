## Summary
This is a project that simulates an animal shelter system. The project provides an AnimalShelter class that allows you to enqueue and dequeue cats and dogs. The shelter operates on a "first in, first out" basis, meaning the animals are dequeued in the order they were enqueued.

## Approach 

The project consists of the following files:

AnimalShelter.cs: Contains the AnimalShelter class, which implements the shelter system.

Animal.cs: Defines the Animal base class with properties for Species and Name.

Cat.cs: Defines the Cat class, which is a subclass of Animal, and sets the species to "cat."

Dog.cs: Defines the Dog class, which is a subclass of Animal, and sets the species to "dog."

## Efficiency
Enqueue method time complixity is O(1) Dequeue method time complixity is O(1)
