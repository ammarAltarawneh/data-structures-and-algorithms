# Hash Table

Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value.

## Approach & Efficiency
Time complexity for Set, Get and Contains methods are O(n) while n = linked list nodes in specific index (collision).

Time complexity for Keys method is O(n*m) while n = Table length and m = linked list nodes in specific index (collision).

Time complexity for Hash method is O(n) while n = key length.
